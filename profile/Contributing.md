# Contributing to Quantum Space

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Quantum Space project! We highly appreciate all forms of contributions, whether it's fixing bugs, introducing new features, or improving our documentation.

## Getting Involved

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you contribute:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Begin by creating your own copy (fork) of the Quantum Space repository on GitHub.
    * [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Quantum-Space-Org/quantum-space/fork)

2.  **Create a Dedicated Branch:** For each contribution, create a new branch with a descriptive name. This helps in organizing your work and makes the review process smoother. Examples: `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/data-validation`.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature
    ```

3.  **Implement Your Changes:** Now, make the necessary modifications and additions within your created branch.

4.  **Write Comprehensive Tests:** If you're introducing a new feature or resolving a bug, it's crucial to include tests that validate your changes and prevent regressions in the future.

5.  **Commit Your Work Clearly:** When committing your changes, use clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your modifications.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add new feature: Implement user authentication"
    ```

6.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Once you've made your changes and are satisfied, create a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original Quantum Space repository.

## Writing Effective Commit Messages

Well-crafted commit messages are essential for understanding the project's history. Aim for messages that include:

* **A concise summary** of the changes in the first line (50 characters or less).
* **A more detailed explanation** of the changes in the body, providing context and reasoning.
* **A reference to any related issues** (if applicable), using the `#` symbol followed by the issue number (e.g., `Closes #123`).

**Example:**

Fix: Bug in data processing

This commit addresses an issue in the data processing module that led to incorrect output.
The root cause was an inaccurate calculation within the process_data function.
To ensure the fix is effective, a new test case has been added to cover this specific scenario.

Closes #123
